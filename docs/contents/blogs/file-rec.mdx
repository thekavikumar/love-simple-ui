## Introduction: Crafting a Recursive File System in React

In modern web development, creating interactive and dynamic file systems is a common requirement. Whether for managing documents, organizing projects, or building complex data structures, having a robust file system is crucial. In this blog post, we’ll explore how to build a recursive file system in React, focusing on nested folders and files that can be added, renamed, or deleted.

Check out the project on [GitHub](https://github.com/nisabmohd/recursive-file-system-react) for a complete implementation.

## Project Overview

The Recursive File System project is designed to simulate a file management system where users can interact with folders and files dynamically. It supports the following features:

- **Adding New Folders and Files**: Create new folders and files within any existing folder.
- **Renaming Items**: Change the name of folders and files.
- **Deleting Items**: Remove folders and files from the file system.
- **Nested Structure**: Handle nested folders and files to create a hierarchical view.

## Key Features and Implementation

### 1. Recursive Data Structure

The core of the project is a recursive data structure that represents the file system. Each folder can contain other folders or files, and each file or folder has properties such as `id`, `name`, and `children` (for folders).

Here’s a basic structure for a folder:

```jsx
const folder = {
  id: "1",
  name: "Documents",
  type: "folder",
  children: [
    { id: "2", name: "Resume.pdf", type: "file" },
    { id: "3", name: "CoverLetter.docx", type: "file" },
  ],
};
```

### 2. Components

The project includes several key components to handle different aspects of the file system:

- **FileExplorer**: Displays the entire file system and handles rendering folders and files.

```jsx
// src/components/FileExplorer.js
import React, { useState } from "react";
import Folder from "./Folder";
import File from "./File";

const FileExplorer = () => {
  const [files, setFiles] = useState(initialData); // initialData is your recursive data structure

  const addItem = (parentId, type) => {
    // Logic to add a folder or file
  };

  const renameItem = (id, newName) => {
    // Logic to rename a folder or file
  };

  const deleteItem = (id) => {
    // Logic to delete a folder or file
  };

  return (
    <div>
      {files.map((file) =>
        file.type === "folder" ? (
          <Folder
            key={file.id}
            folder={file}
            onAdd={addItem}
            onRename={renameItem}
            onDelete={deleteItem}
          />
        ) : (
          <File
            key={file.id}
            file={file}
            onRename={renameItem}
            onDelete={deleteItem}
          />
        )
      )}
    </div>
  );
};

export default FileExplorer;
```

- **Folder**: Renders folders and handles nested items.

```jsx
// src/components/Folder.js
import React from "react";
import FileExplorer from "./FileExplorer";

const Folder = ({ folder, onAdd, onRename, onDelete }) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h3>{folder.name}</h3>
      <button onClick={() => onAdd(folder.id, "folder")}>Add Folder</button>
      <button onClick={() => onAdd(folder.id, "file")}>Add File</button>
      <button onClick={() => onRename(folder.id, "New Name")}>Rename</button>
      <button onClick={() => onDelete(folder.id)}>Delete</button>
      {folder.children && <FileExplorer files={folder.children} />}
    </div>
  );
};

export default Folder;
```

- **File**: Renders individual files with options to rename and delete.

```jsx
// src/components/File.js
import React from "react";

const File = ({ file, onRename, onDelete }) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <p>{file.name}</p>
      <button onClick={() => onRename(file.id, "New Name")}>Rename</button>
      <button onClick={() => onDelete(file.id)}>Delete</button>
    </div>
  );
};

export default File;
```

### 3. Handling State and Actions

State management is handled using React hooks like `useState` to manage the file system data. Actions such as adding, renaming, and deleting items update the state accordingly.

```jsx
const [files, setFiles] = useState(initialData);

const addItem = (parentId, type) => {
  // Logic to add a new item to the file system
};

const renameItem = (id, newName) => {
  // Logic to rename an existing item
};

const deleteItem = (id) => {
  // Logic to delete an item
};
```

## Conclusion: Building a Dynamic File System with React

Creating a recursive file system in React is a powerful way to manage hierarchical data and provide a dynamic user experience. By leveraging React's component-based architecture and state management, you can build interactive file systems that handle complex nested structures efficiently.
