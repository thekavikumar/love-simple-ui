Follow these simple instructions to set up your project efficiently and begin creating content without delay!:

## Documentation

1. **Configure Routing**
   - Open the `@lib/route-config.ts` file and add your routing pages:
     ```typescript
     export const ROUTES: EachRoute[] = [
         // Add new route below
         {
             title: "Fundamentals",
             href: "/fundamentals",
             noLink: true, // Set to true to prevent routing
             items: [
                 // All the sub-sections under `fundamentals`
                 { title: "HTTP Server", href: "/http-server" },
             ],
         },
     ];
     ```

2. **Create Content Structure**
   - Navigate to the `@content/docs` directory and create a folder named `fundamentals`, as defined in the `route-config` file. Within this folder, create a subfolder named `http-server`, and inside that, create an `index.mdx` file that will render when you navigate to `/fundamentals/http-server`:
     ```plaintext
     root
     ├── content/docs
     │   └── fundamentals
     │       └── http-server
     │           └── index.mdx
     ```

3. **Write Your Markdown Content**
   - Start writing your markdown content inside the `index.mdx` file. Be sure to include frontmatter at the beginning of the file, which is used for the page title and description:
     ```markdown showLineNumbers {1-4}
     --- 
     title: HTTP Server
     description: This section is about HTTP Server.
     ---

     <!-- Here goes your markdown content -->
     ```

4. **Run Your Application**
   - Ensure your application is running. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/docs/fundamentals/http-server` to view your content. You should also see it in the left panel, allowing you to navigate to other pages.


## Blogs

- Navigate to the `@content/blogs` directory and create a file with a unique name prefixed with `.mdx`, then start writing the markdown content inside.

- Make sure to add the following frontmatter to format data for the blogs properly:
  ```markdown
