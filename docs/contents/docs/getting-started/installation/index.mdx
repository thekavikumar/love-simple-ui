Setting up AriaDocs is straightforward, with options to clone the repository or use the convenient `npx` command. AriaDocs requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) version 18 or higher for optimal performance.

## Clone Repository
To get started, you can clone the AriaDocs repository directly from GitHub. 
<Stepper>
  <StepperItem title="Step 1: Clone the AriaDocs Repository">

    <Note title="Remember">
      To support React 19, package maintainers will need to test and update their packages to include React 19 as a peer dependency. This is already in progress.
    </Note>

    ```plaintext
    npm install
    ```
  </StepperItem>

  <StepperItem title="Step 4: Launch the Development Server">
    Finally, start the development server to view the project locally:

    ```plaintext
    npm run dev
    ```
  </StepperItem>
</Stepper>

## Quick Setup with npx

For a faster setup, use the `npx` command to create a new AriaDocs project in one step:

```plaintext
npx create-aria-doc <project-directory>
```

**Command Output:**

```plaintext

Cloning Master (Full Documentation)...
AriaDocs project successfully created in /path/to/your/project!

Next steps:
1. Navigate to your project directory:
   cd <project-directory>
2. Install dependencies:
   npm install
3. Start the development server:
   npm run dev
```

With this setup, youâ€™ll have a ready-to-use AriaDocs instance to start building your documentation.
