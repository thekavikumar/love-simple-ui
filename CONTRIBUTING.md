## Submitting Pull Requests

Before you create a pull request, please take a moment to review the guidelines outlined below. Following these guidelines will help ensure a smooth and efficient collaboration process.

1. Fork the repository:
    
    ![https://i.postimg.cc/xCjqddnh/fork.png](https://i.postimg.cc/xCjqddnh/fork.png)
    
2. Clone the forked repository to your local machine:
    
    ### Using Command Line
    
    ‚Äé
    Copy the **URL**
    
    ![https://i.postimg.cc/KYj4gSQ4/clone-URL.png](https://i.postimg.cc/KYj4gSQ4/clone-URL.png)
    
    ```
    git clone [URL goes here]
    cd <repo-name>
    
    ```
    
- If you have already forked the project, update your copy before working.
    
    ```
    git remote update
    git checkout <branch-name>
    git rebase upstream/<branch-name>
    
    ```
    
    ‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning:** Avoid Coding in the Main Branch ‚ö†Ô∏è
    
- Create a new branch for your changes:
    
    **Note:** Creating a new branch allows for isolated development and avoids merge conflicts while making PRs
    
    ```
    git checkout -b my-branch
    # Utilize the branch name to specify the type of issue you are addressing, whether it's a feature, bug fix, or enhancement.
    
    ```
    
- Commit and push your changes to your forked repository:
    
    **Note:** A PR should have only one commit. Multiple commits should be squashed. Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should be more descriptive.
    
- Make sure all of your commits are atomic (one feature per commit).
    
    ```
    git add .
    git commit -m "Add my changes"
    git push origin my-branch
    
    ```
    
- Go to your repository in browser and click on compare and pull requests. Then add a title and description to your pull request that explains your contribution.

### Best Practices for Creating a Pull Request (PR):

- **Clear and Descriptive Title:** Provide a concise, descriptive title for your PR.
- **Detailed Description:** Include a thorough description of your changes.
- List specific changes made in a clear and concise manner. Mention any major code modifications, added functionality, or removed features.
- Create a checklist to help maintainers review the changes more effectively.
- Include screenshots or GIFs showcasing visual changes or new features.
- Mention any additional information or considerations that might be relevant.
- Be responsive to any feedback or change requests during the review process.

**Note:** [Getting started with GitHub Desktop](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/installing-and-configuring-github-desktop/getting-started-with-github-desktop) will guide you through setting up Desktop. Once Desktop is set up, you can use it to [fork the repo](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/cloning-and-forking-repositories-from-github-desktop)!
